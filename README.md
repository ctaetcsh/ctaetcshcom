## License
This repository does not have a license and thus no permissability. That said, I don't really care if you use some of the code for your own project. HOWEVER, any images (excluding icons from Bootstrap) are under my copyright and I forbid any unauthorized use of them. If you do use my precious cat photos without my written permission, expect a DMCA notice. :)

## Thanks
* Icons: Icons from the Bootstrap icon set.
